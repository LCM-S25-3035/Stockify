# 📈 Stock Allocation using Reinforcement Learning (RL)

This project implements a **multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)** approach for **stock portfolio allocation**, enhanced with **market regime awareness**. The goal is to develop intelligent agents that learn to allocate capital efficiently across multiple stocks, dynamically adapting to different market regimes (e.g., bull, bear, sideways) for robust performance.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🧠 **Multi-Agent RL**: Each agent learns to allocate funds to a subset or all of the assets, allowing for specialization and collaboration.
- 📊 **Market Regime Awareness**: Market regime detection models guide the agents to switch or adjust strategies based on current market conditions.
- 🔁 **Continuous Learning**: Agents learn from historical price data using advanced RL algorithms.
